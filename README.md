# Cup Matching Game ðŸŽ®

A fun and interactive cup matching game inspired by a popular TikTok challenge! The player needs to match the top cups in the correct order, while the bottom cups are hidden. After every move, the game tells you how many cups are in the right place, and once all the cups are correctly matched, the final order is revealed!

## Game Description

The objective of the game is to arrange the cups in the correct order. The bottom row of cups is hidden from the player's view (similar to a cardboard box hiding them) and will only be revealed at the end of the game. Each time the player makes a move and submits, they receive feedback on how many cups are in the correct positions but not which specific ones.

## Features

- **Randomized Cup Order:** The cups are randomly shuffled at the start of the game.
- **Interactive Feedback:** After every move, the player is told how many cups are in the correct place.
- **Endgame Reveal:** Once the player correctly matches all the cups, the hidden cups are revealed.
- **User Interface:** The game has a simple UI with visual elements replacing a cardboard box for hiding cups.
  
## How to Play

1. The game starts with a random order of cups on the bottom, which are hidden.
2. The player arranges the top row of cups in what they believe is the correct order.
3. Upon pressing the "Submit Move" button, the game will tell how many cups are correctly placed.
